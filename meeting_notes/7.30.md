Finshed:
1. timing the performance for both serial implementation and overall implementation
2. using L1, L2, L_infi 

On-going:
1. try to optimize more! Need more try
2. Edit the draft/ or rewrite them all!!!


New:
1. Rewrite all the background part
2. Express the error on each lattice
3. more content on the design and implementation
