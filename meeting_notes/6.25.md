On-going:
1. Keep working on SpiNNaker porting with asuming that the C implementaion is correct.
2. consider when to save the result, during the simulation or in the end. Here in the end might be easier.

New:
1. we use renalt number to assure we are talking about the same question as Brown
2. Make the simulation iteration larger e.g. 10000
3. Make C implementation to the report and explain the test problem in more detail


Finished:
1. Port the computation steps to the SpiNNaker with assuming the C implementation is correct.
2. Use floating point instead of fixed point numerical arithmetic
