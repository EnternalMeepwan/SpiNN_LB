Questions:
1. There are some minor difference between the calculated numbers of spiNNaker and the srial C code. How can I know if it is simply because of the floating point error. But I've test the functions one by one
2. It is not stable at all. When it come to communicate a lot. we cannot garuntee when the calculation can finish. If the calcaulation is not finish, and there;s a clock update, then the simualtion is wrong.



On-going:
1. Find out why the result is different
2. Working on the first draft of report


Finished:
1. Physics part finished with Kevin
2. transfer most of the C code into spinnaker code. Have already test the most functions with its functionalities.
3. The code can run with 12000 iterations, but not stable.
4. The code can run with 128 * 128 lattice
5. Add some materials to the disertation reports. but still on constraction


New:
1. From Alan: test which part of SpiNNaker produce the error
2. test the functions one by one and find out which introduce error
