Finished:
1. The code is complete and we get the same output as the pure C LBM. We make it
2. A minor problem:
2020-07-19 16:57:13 WARNING: Link 44311 points to Chip (45, 32) but that is not included

A: This is because sometimes the core cannot connect correctly. leave it the software take it all.

3. Before I The performance is quite slow.  Now I make it to run in 2 mins. By add gaps between sending and a random delay for timer

On-going:
1. It take a long time to load configuration specification. Any ideas?
2. how to test the correct: the result is minor different
3. how to visualize the result better

New:
1. use the doulbe CPU implementation as the correct one. Quantify the result.
2. possibly a larger simulation ? say 1024 * 1024?
