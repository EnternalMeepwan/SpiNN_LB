Question:
it always take a huge amount of time to Extracte the IOBUF from the machine. which probably make the large scale simulation hard.

I just send the log information to alan. I've thought that it was an error. But according to alan, it an warnning. So the result is correct with regard to the code.


On-going:
1. confirm the correctness on the physical side. how accuracy of the implemetation?
2. get the performance better? in which way?

Finished:
1. the basic implemetation of lb on spiannake. but it takes 20 mins, which is unacceptable



New:
1. Save vorticity into a file 
2. send the email to the spinnaker user group about the IO buffer
3. show a pictuer in the of SPINNAKER implemetation
